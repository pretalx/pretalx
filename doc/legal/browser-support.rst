Browser support policy
======================

We develop pretalx to work with the following browsers:

- Mozilla Firefox (Android and Desktop)
- Google Chrome (Android and Desktop)
- Microsoft Edge (Desktop)
- Apple Safari (macOS and iOS)

Browser versions
----------------

We support the **current release** of each of our supported browsers.

Testing and maintaining compatibility with older browser versions would require significant additional effort that we cannot provide as part of standard development.
If you require support for older browsers, please `contact us <mailto:support@pretalx.com>`_ to discuss a custom support agreement.

Screen sizes
------------

pretalx aims to work on small screens as well as larger ones.
However, data-heavy organiser views (such as the submission list or review dashboard) will work better on larger screens by nature.

Reporting issues
----------------

If you encounter bugs with supported browsers or problems on smaller screens, please `open an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/pretalx/pretalx/issues>`_.
We appreciate bug reports and usually respond quickly.
