Basic concepts
==============

This page describes basic concepts and definition that you need to know to
interact with the pretalx REST API, such as authentication, pagination and
similar definitions.

.. _`rest-auth`:

Obtaining an API token
----------------------

To authenticate your API requests, you need to obtain an API token. You can
view your API token in the organizer frontend at ``/orga/me``, or you can
direct a POST request containing your ``username`` and ``password`` to
``/api/auth`` – this endpoint will respond with ``{"token": "abcd…"}``.


Authentication
--------------

You need to include the API token with every request to the API in the
``Authorization`` header like the following:

.. sourcecode:: http
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   GET /api/v1/organizers/ HTTP/1.1
   Authorization: Token e1l6gq2ye72thbwkacj7jbri7a7tvxe614ojv8ybureain92ocub46t5gab5966k

.. note:: The API currently also supports authentication via browser sessions,
          i.e. the same way that you authenticate with pretalx when using the
          browser interface.  Using this type of authentication is *not*
          officially supported for use by third-party clients and might change
          or be removed at any time. If you want to use session authentication,
          be sure to comply with Django's `CSRF policies`_.

Compatibility
-------------

The API is currently under heavy development – please don't rely on its format
to remain the same. We will document changes in our changelog, and release
notes, as always.

We may always add additional fields or endpoints, or support additional methods
or query parameters on existing endpoints without further notice, so please
make sure your client can deal with this.

We will give prior notice in our changelog and release notes before removing
endpoints, API methods, fields, or before changing response fields, or
requiring new input fields or types.

Pagination
----------

Most lists of objects returned by the API will be paginated. The response will
take the form of:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    {
        "count": 117,
        "next": "https://pretalx.org/api/v1/organizers/?limit=20&offset=40",
        "previous": null,
        "results": […],
    }

As you can see, the response contains the total number of results in the field
``count``.  The fields ``next`` and ``previous`` contain links to the next and
previous page of results, respectively, or ``null`` if there is no such page.
You can use those URLs to retrieve the respective page.

The field ``results`` contains a list of objects representing the first
results. For most objects, every page contains 25 results.

Errors
------

Error responses (of type 400-499) are returned in one of the following forms, depending on
the type of error. General errors look like:

.. sourcecode:: http

   HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Length: 42

   {"detail": "Method 'DELETE' not allowed."}

Field specific input errors include the name of the offending fields as keys in the response:

.. sourcecode:: http

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Length: 94

   {"amount": ["A valid integer is required."], "description": ["This field may not be blank."]}


Data types
----------

All structured API responses are returned in JSON format using standard JSON
data types such as integers, floating point numbers, strings, lists, objects
and booleans. Most fields can be ``null`` as well.

The following table shows some data types that have no native JSON
representation and how we serialize them to JSON.

===================== ============================ ===================================
Internal type         JSON representation          Examples
===================== ============================ ===================================
Datetime              String in ISO 8601 format    ``"2017-12-27T10:00:00Z"``
                      with timezone (normally UTC) ``"2017-12-27T10:00:00.596934Z"``,
                                                   ``"2017-12-27T10:00:00+02:00"``
Date                  String in ISO 8601 format    ``2017-12-27``
Multi-lingual string  Object of strings            ``{"en": "red", "de": "rot"}``
===================== ============================ ===================================

Query parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most list endpoints allow a filtering of the results using query parameters. In
this case, booleans should be passed as the string values ``true`` and
``false``.

Most list endpoints support searching a few select fields of the resources.
This search will be case insensitive unless noted otherwise, and can be
accessed via the ``?q=`` query parameter.

If the ``o`` parameter is documented to order a resource, you can use it to
sort the result set by one of the allowed fields. Prepend a ``-`` to the field
name to reverse the sort order.
