Release Notes
=============

- :feature:`454`: As an organizer, it is now possible to send an email to all reviewers in the Compose Mail section.
- :feature:`492`: In exports, HTTP Etags are now supported to allow for more aggressive caching on clients.
- :bug:`-` If a review question was mandatory while submission questions were active, they would block the submission process.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now also reset the password for the speakers they have access to.

- :feature:`-` The sneak peek / is_featured flag is now shown in the submissions and talk API endpoints.
