Release Notes
=============

- :support:`-` Email error reporting (sent to instance administrators) now includes a short explanation and a link to the pretalx issue tracker.
- :feature:`-` If a speaker has selected to show their gravatar, it is now also exposed in the API in the avatar field.
- :feature:`-` When you send out reminders about unanswered questions, you can now target specific questions, or tracks, or submission types.
- :feature:`-` pretalx now limits file uploads to 10MB.
- :feature:`979` In the schedule editor, you can now search for talks by speaker name.
- :feature:`-` pretalx now shows the complete history of logged changes to organisers.
- :support:`-` pretalx will no longer make alarmist noises about missing migrations.
- :feature:`882` You can now filter the submission list by specific question answers.
- :feature:`-` Questions that are visible to reviewers now also show up on the review page, to avoid having to switch to the full submission view in the review process.
- :bug:`928` Reviewers had access to question answers that were not explicitly visible to reviewers by way of the API.
- :bug:`923` In some settings combinations, reviewers were unable to change or even see their own reviews after submitting them.
- :feature:`907` pretalx now prevents you from creating multiple tracks or submission types with the same name.
- :bug:`951` The link to the team settings on the review settings page was incorrect.
- :bug:`945` Internationalised strings were not always shown as such in the API, sometimes they were instead returned as plain strings.
- :feature:`947` In all exporters, you can now select the export language with the ``?lang=`` query parameter. If you don't supply the parameter, pretalx will continue to guess your locale as before. If you provide the parameter without a value, the default event locale will be used.
- :feature:`934` Instead of being unsorted as before, the list of talks on the schedule page is now sorted alphabetically.
- :bug:`936` The submission API returned a duration in formatted time, like "00:30", but the API documentation claimed it was a number of minutes. pretalx now returns the number of minutes as promised.
- :feature:`915` Tracks now have a description attached to them which is shown to the user in the CfP, if specified. This can be used to further explain an otherwise very short track name.
- :feature:`-` Redirects to an event domain now include CORS headers to permit access from any client, to make pretalx integration in other websites easier.
- :feature:`-` If you go to a login page while you are logged in (e.g. because it was still open in another tab), you are now redirected instead of being prompted to log in.
- :feature:`-` Exporters can now supply the CORS header they want to send. All exporters provided by pretalx directly now allow access from all origins by default.
- :feature:`772` Organisers can now leave a public comment when they release a new schedule. It will be visible in the changelog and the schedule RSS feed.
- :feature:`830` Administrators can now configure static and media files to be under different URLs than ``static`` and ``media``.
- :bug:`-` Using custom mail servers worked, but testing the connection in the settings page showed an error (incorrectly).
- :feature:`-` Plugin developers can now add content to the HTML head area with the new ``pretalx.cfp.signals.html_head`` signal.
- :feature:`-` If you move your event dates, the schedule is moved too, and you can send notifications to your speakers by releasing a new schedule version.
- :bug:`-` Firefox has a bug in their form caching. If you reviewed a submission, clicked "Save and next", then *went back and reloaded the page*, Firefox would incorrectly fill your review form with the choice *one point worse* than your original selection. If you then chose "Save and next" again, this value would be saved.
- :feature:`-` The test event creation command now allows you to specify the event slug. This allows you to generate multiple test events in various event stages.
- :bug:`-` A bug in our permission checks made pretalx unable to run on Windows.
- :feature:`-` Schedule notifications for speakers are now properly connected to the speaker accounts, instead of just referencing them by email addresses.
- :feature:`-` Now, event organisers can activate and deactivate plugins for their events. Previously this was restricted to administrators.
- :support:`-` If you have a plugin that listens to the ``footer_link`` signal, please change it so that it returns a list of dictionaries instead of a single dictionary. The dictionary-only return value is deprecated and support will be removed in a future pretalx version.
- :feature:`-` The new signal ``pretalx.common.signals.activitylog_display`` allows plugins to change how entries in the pretalx activity log are displayed.
- :feature:`-` The new signal ``pretalx.orga.signals.event_copy_data`` allows plugins to transfer data from one event to the next at event creation time.
- :feature:`-` The help text for questions can now be 800 characters long instead of 200.
- :bug:`-` Under specific circumstances, the ``django_sessions`` table could bloat a lot. This is fixed with the next release and the table will shrink over time as long as you regularly run the ``clearsessions`` command.
- :feature:`855` The filtered list of speakers in the organiser area now contains only people with confirmed *or accepted* talks, and is also better at showing the filter currently applied.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now anonymise submission content for reviewers, if they choose to do anonymised reviews. They can redact or edit any part of the submission for the reviewers' view of it to remove identifying information.
- :bug:`-` It wasn't possible to hide a submission type unless accessed with an access token. (Or, well, it was possible, but the possibility was hidden.)
- :feature:`880` The submission statistics now ignore deleted submissions.
- :support:`-` This version of pretalx has higher database version requirements. We now support PostgreSQL 9.6+, MariaDB 10.1+, MySQL 5.6+, and SQLite 3.8.3+.
- :bug:`877` The frontend markdown preview would not render all line breaks as line breaks (only two line breaks in a row), but the server rendered version did.
- :feature:`873` If you create a new event and copy an old event's configuration, pretalx will now also copy tracks and questions.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now choose how to display their schedule. Currently, the only two options are the previous grid display, or a list with talks and times.
- :feature:`-` In the API, the event list is now sorted so that the oldest event comes last, not first as it was before.
- :feature:`-` If your event has only a single language configured, pretalx won't show the language flag in the input fields anymore.
- :support:`-` To make translation contributions more accessible, you can now improve translations (or add new ones!) at `translate.pretalx.com <https://translate.pretalx.com>`_
- :feature:`-` pretalx now comes with an updated French translation, and a brand new Chinese community translation!
- :bug:`863` If incorrect variables were used in the schedule update email template, pretalx did not catch this mistake ahead of time, and instead just refused to release a new schedule.
- :feature:`-` A lot of minor UI improvements, a re-work of the colours and fonts in use, as well as improvements of mobile and responsive pages.
- :feature:`-` Review scores are now consistently shown as numbers, and the text representation/meaning of those numbers is shown on hover.
- :feature:`-` Reviewers can now see both their own score and the median score in the review dashboard.
- :feature:`-` People without edit or delete permissions are not shown the edit or delete buttons on submissions anymore.
- :bug:`-` When updating the settings for an event with a custom domain, pretalx would mistakenly show an error message that this domain was already in use for another event.
- :release:`1.1.2 <2020-01-10>`
- :bug:`-` If a CfP requested the submitters' availability at submission time, only logged-in users could successfully finish the submission workflow.
- :release:`1.1.1 <2020-01-10>`
- :bug:`844` The 1.1.0 release was only installable via git (either by way of pip URLs or a full checkout), not by pip on its own.
- :bug:`-` The list of all submission feedback given in a single event was only usable for people with administrator permissions.
- :bug:`-` Not all CfP form help text parts were translated.
- :release:`1.1.0 <2019-12-21>`
- :feature:`-` pretalx now comes with an update check, which will notify you when new pretalx or plugin versions are available. This check sends anonymous data to the pretalx.com server, which is run by the pretalx developer. The data consist of a random but stable ID, the number of total and public events, and the version of pretalx and all installed plugins. No identifying information will be retained, and there is a visible and persistent opt-out warning until acknowledged by an administrator.
- :bug:`-` One broken task among the periodically executed task would prevent others from being executed.
- :bug:`828` Deleted talks could still be shown with their previous title and speaker. Now they are always replaced with a box saying "[deleted]" with no further information.
- :bug:`816` Reducing the slot count of a submission where all slots had been scheduled would not remove spare slots.
- :feature:`-` Plugins can now add content to the top of the user profile pages and the user-private submission lists.
- :feature:`841` File attachments generated from user data are now generated to be in safe ASCII range, to avoid trouble with Unicode-sensitive gunicorn versions.
- :feature:`794` There is now a page that shows all feedback by attendees for any talk in the conference.
- :feature:`432` Organisers can now send emails to all speakers who have not uploaded slides/files for their talk yet.
- :feature:`-` pretalx now has pretty error pages for CSRF fails and 400 errors. Test error pages are located at ``/400``, ``/403``, ``/404``, ``/500``, and ``/403/csrf``.
- :feature:`792` There is now a CSV export for answered questions.
- :feature:`814` Questions of the type "choose one from a list" are now shown as a list of radio input options instead of a single drop-down, if there are three or less options to choose from.
- :feature:`-` Plugins can now implement the ``uninstalled`` method to perform actions when a user deactivates them for an event.
- :support:`-` We documented the implicit requirement that the filesystem pretalx accesses should work with non-ASCII file names. Please check the installation documentation if you want to make sure this is the case for you.
- :feature:`-` The submission type list and the track list now list the numbers of submissions per entry.
- :feature:`638` You can now determine if the answers to talk questions should be visible to reviewers. This allows you to ask personal questions of your submitters, even when you are running an anonymous review process.
- :feature:`648` pretalx now comes with a CfP editor that allows you to change the headline, text, and help texts on each of the CfP step pages.
- :feature:`760` Speakers can now see and reset their API token in their profile page.
- :support:`-` We have added a couple of pages to the pretalx wiki on GitHub, most importantly a list of events using pretalx, and a list of available plugins. The wiki is world-writable, so please add to it if you have an event or plugin that hasn't been mentioned yet!
- :feature:`277` The static HTML export will now be triggered when talk or speaker data is changed (as long as it's also generated on schedule release). To protect against high server load, it will still run at most once every hour.
- :feature:`-` To reduce scroll wheel abrasions, pretalx schedules are now tabbed with one tab per event day.
- :feature:`-` You can now embed a widget of the pretalx schedule on your own pages. You can generate the HTML necessary for the widget in your event settings.
- :feature:`242` pretalx has learned what breaks are. Organisers can create those in the schedule editor, and they will be shown in an appropriately muted way in the schedule.
- :feature:`324` Organisers can create access tokens that allow users to submit after the CfP deadline, or that give access to hidden tracks or submission types.
- :feature:`-` pretalx has the new management command ``create_test_event``, which creates a demo event in a stage of your choice (``cfp``, ``review``, ``schedule`` or ``over``). All user accounts are created with ``@example.org`` email addresses.
- :feature:`-` If you want to display your schedule on your own homepage, pretalx now offers you a schedule widget. You can generate the code for the widget in your organiser settings.
- :feature:`-` For events that span multiple days, pretalx now shows the conference days in a tabbed display, instead of requiring you to scroll a lot.
- :feature:`-` If pretalx encounters an error it can't recover from, the error page now shows a link to a partially filled GitHub issue.
- :bug:`-` pretalx would show an error when users were asked to select their submission's track during the CfP workflow.
- :release:`1.0.4 <2019-10-15>`
- :bug:`-` In feedback pages for talks that contained multiple speakers, the email addresses of those speakers were shown next to their names.
- :feature:`-` Allow users to add an imprint URL that will be shown at the bottom of every public event page.
- :bug:`-` On the sneak peek preview page, markdown wasn't rendered correctly to HTML.
- :feature:`-` If pretalx is running in development mode, its favicon will be red.
- :feature:`-` Plugin authors will now have access to all configuration sections starting with ``[plugin:*]``, to ease the integration of system level settings.
- :feature:`787` Provide the file uploads a speaker added to their submission via the ``/talks`` and ``/submissions`` API endpoint.
- :feature:`-` Show speakers how many feedback notes have been left (if any) in their personal submission list view.
- :feature:`-` Answers to boolean questions are not displayed as "yes", "no", and "maybe" in public display, instead of "true" or "false".
- :bug:`775` When a speaker withdrew their already-accepted talk, the talk slot was not removed from the schedule editor. It did work when setting the state via the organiser interface.
- :bug:`774` The API endpoint for events always returned a 404 on the detail view, even when event was visible in the list view.
- :feature:`-` Speaker and talk detail pages now contain links to their respective API detail pages as alternate links.
- :feature:`-` The main schedule page now returns a 303 See Also redirect if accessed with JSON or XML accept headers.
- :bug:`773` In the ``/talks`` and ``/submissions`` endpoints, speaker biographies were not exposed. They were available in the ``/speakers`` endpoint as expected, so if you cannot currently upgrade, please be advised to use that endpoint.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now disable/remove the profile picture input field if they don't want any speaker pictures at all.
- :feature:`-` The event creation assistant now suggests more sensible event slugs.
- :feature:`-` The time(s), date(s) and location(s) of scheduled talks were added to the private speaker pages of those talks, making it easier for speakers to find out when and where their talk is taking place.
- :feature:`-` The API is now also available as an HTML browsable API. Filters and searches should be working as well as just browsing around.
- :feature:`-` The events API endpoint now comes with a field exposing links to the schedule page, and the login page, among other things.
- :bug:`754` Reviews could be returned multiple times in the reviews API endpoint (though the total count returned was correct).
- :feature:`742` Organisers can now set a minimum or maximum length for submission titles.
- :feature:`743` If no schedule has been published but a sneak peek is available, the schedule page now redirects to the sneak peek page.
- :feature:`-` The pretalx markdown display now supports markdown tables.
- :feature:`-` Due to the powerful and hard-to-specify nature of the schedule HTML import, the frontend facing schedule XML import has been removed. Administrators can still import schedule files with the ``import_schedule`` command.
- :release:`1.0.3 <2019-06-27>`
- :bug:`730` The talk page of talks with multiple slots did not work and threw an error instead.
- :bug:`729` The “unscheduled talks” column in the schedule editor could overlap with the room columns on events with many rooms.
- :bug:`728` The “Invite reviewers” link on the main event dashboard led to an incorrect page.
- :feature:`732` Speaker availability is now included in the API for organisers.
- :feature:`475` Organisers can now regenerate the accept/reject emails from the review dashboard context menu.
- :support:`-` To keep in line with our new database scoping, if you access the pretalx shell, you are now advised to use the ``shell_scoped`` command instead of the ``shell`` command, and call it with the flags for your event, like ``--event__slug=my-event`` (or an ``--override`` flag to access all events).
- :feature:`731` Users can now see (and potentially edit) their submission's submission type.
- :bug:`-` Some custom domains could not be set via the frontend.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now also see unconfirmed talks in their preview of the public schedule page. The unconfirmed talks are clearly marked to avoid confusion.
- :release:`1.0.2 <2019-06-07>`
- :bug:`-` Organisers were able to see all emails sent to a user in their events, instead of only emails sent for the currently active event. This is a data leak. You can find more information `on our blog <https://pretalx.com/p/news/incident-report-data-leak-in-pretalx-10/>`_.
- :feature:`-` We now add a hash to all uploaded file names to avoid collisions.
- :release:`1.0.1 <2019-06-03>`
- :bug:`719` In the submission process, file upload questions would not be saved correctly.
- :bug:`713` The sneak peek toggle in the submission list did not actually work due to a changed URL.
- :bug:`718` Regular installation from PyPI was broken due to an incorrect file reference.
- :release:`1.0.0 <2019-06-02>`
- :feature:`427` Organisers can now permit users to submit (and change) their own talk duration length.
- :feature:`700` Submitters can now choose to withdraw their talk even if it was accepted. When an accepted talk is withdrawn, the organisers will receive a notification email.
- :feature:`-` When using a command line client to access a schedule page, pretalx will now output ASCII tables or lists, depending on the format parameter.
- :feature:`402` Fields with markdown support now come with a preview next to the input field (if JavaScript is enabled).
- :feature:`669` Emails can now also be sent grouped by submission track or submission type.
- :support:`-` You can now install ``pretalx[redis]`` if you use pretalx with a redis server for better caching and/or asynchronous task runners.
- :support:`-` Our documentation now lists the tasks a pretalx instance should run periodically, namely ``runperiodic`` about once every five minutes, and ``clearsessions`` about once a month.
- :feature:`-` Administrators can now see a dashboard with relevant settings and current information, including documentation links.
- :bug:`689` In the (undocumented) review API, reviews of deleted submissions were shown, even though those submissions were not available anymore via the frontend.
- :bug:`688` pretalx was inconsistent in its usage of email senders and Reply-To. Now, if there is a sender address configured, the Reply-To is not explicitly set. pretalx falls back to the instance-global sender if there is no event sender address. A Reply-To setting is available if the organisers wish to provide a separate address there.
- :feature:`682` The submission endpoint now provides a ``created`` field to organiser users.
- :feature:`326` During event creation, pretalx provides more critical feedback, such as asking if the event is supposed to take place in the past, or suggesting good slugs.
- :feature:`393` As an alternative to file uploads, organisers can now also provide their custom CSS directly as text.
- :feature:`360` Within the review dashboard, organisers can now accept and reject multiple submissions at the same time.
- :feature:`656` Instead of by average, review scores are now shown aggregated by the median.
- :bug:`655` Mails to submissions with titles near the length cap (of 200 characters) could not be created, since with the added "[event]" prefix the mail subject was too long to be saved.
- :feature:`-` Question pages now feature visual statistics where appropriate.
- :feature:`-` There now is a page for submission statistics.
- :feature:`628` Fill CfP form with track and submission type if they are available in the query string.
- :support:`-` pretalx is now able to run with Python 3.7 even when using Celery.
- :feature:`598` Via the new review phase settings, speakers can be allowed to modify their submissions while they are being reviewed.
- :feature:`641` At the undocumented URL `/<event>/speaker/by-id/123/` there is now a redirect to the canonical speaker URL `/<event>/speaker/CODE/` to work around export format restrictions.
- :bug:`565` When using the back button to return to the previous step in the submission workflow, the data from the current step had to be filled in to use the button, but was not saved. Now it will be saved, and the progress bar on top can be used for lossy (but quick) navigation to the previous step.
- :bug:`645` The rendering of the full submission content in the acknowledgement mail (upon submission) looked weird in HTML, due to missing line breaks.
- :bug:`646` On slow network connections, the login step of the CfP submission loaded in a sub-optimal way, leaving users with a seemingly finished page but without the login/registration form. As a consequence, all page loads (but especially that one) were optimised.
- :bug:`642` Having only one submission type in the event showed a drop-down with submission types from ALL events, instead of hiding the submission type input completely as intended.
- :feature:`609` Organisers can now filter submissions and reviews by track.
- :feature:`634` The API now provides internal notes by speakers and organisers to requesting users with adequate permissions.
- :feature:`-` Organiser can now provide a header image instead of a header colour and pattern for their events.
- :feature:`640` Instead of having to scroll with the mouse wheel or arrow keys when dragging a talk in the schedule editor, you can now just drag the talk to the upper or lower edge of the window instead.
- :feature:`-` In pretalx, emails the organisers send out are now connected with user accounts if the address matches anybody, allowing organisers and speakers to see which emails were sent to a speaker. This serves both as a help for organisers and speakers, in case emails get lost, email addresses are inaccessible, or any other issues occur.
- :feature:`637` pretalx will now display the schedule wider the more rooms are present, starting at four rooms and reaching maximum browser width for six rooms, to make schedules look less cramped and more readable.
- :feature:`620` Speakers can't invite other speakers any longer after the CfP is over.
- :support:`606` Our documentation now explains which parts of pretalx to back up.
- :feature:`486` In the schedule editor, the room names and the current date are now fixed to the top when scrolling down.
- :bug:`618` Fix a bug where some fields in the schedule XML export were rendered without their timezone offset (only day definitions, not the talk times).
- :feature:`532` Add a field for notes of the organisers for their own use which is not visible to the public and the speakers.
- :feature:`-` Reviewers are now shown a progress bar when going through submissions.
- :feature:`570` Submissions can now be scheduled multiple times, e.g. if a workshop will be held twice.
- :bug:`-` Changing the order of rooms made the schedule break.
- :feature:`433` Organisers can now view all reviews, except for their own submissions.
- :feature:`589` Before setting a new custom domain for an event, pretalx now checks if the domain has any DNS records.
- :bug:`-` A dependency of ours introduced an XSS vulnerability, which organisers could use to execute JavaScript during the CfP workflow of speakers via question texts. We have added a fix against this behaviour, and submitted a report including a patch to the upstream library. To prevent issues like this one in the future, we've moved all remaining JavaScript sources to files, and set the according CSP header, so that execution of inline JavaScript will be disabled.
- :feature:`364` Speakers can now invite a co-speaker while in the submission process.
- :feature:`62` Exporters can now opt in to show a QR code to their location. The XML and iCal exporters show a QR code linking their location by default.
- :feature:`477` If you only noticed after releasing your schedule that you wanted to changes something in your speaker notifications, you can now generate those emails again from the schedule editor actions menu.
- :bug:`479` When telling speakers about their scheduled or rescheduled slots, a hidden mail template was used instead of the actual template visible to the organiser.
- :feature:`563` For later reference, the full submission is included in the confirmation mail sent to the speaker.
- :bug:`571` When adding a submission as organiser, pretalx did not validate the speaker email address and then tried to send them an email regardless of its validity.
- :feature:`403` Organisers can now choose question answers by speakers to be published on the talk/speaker pages. This setting cannot be changed on once the question has been answered, to make sure that speakers are informed about this.
- :feature:`-` Reviewer teams can now be restricted to one or multiple tracks. Reviewers will only see submissions and reviews from these tracks.
- :feature:`-` Teams settings are now located exclusively at the organiser level. The navigation entry in the event sidebar will take you there directly.
- :feature:`523` If you use tracks, you can now choose to make questions available only to submissions on certain tracks.
- :feature:`459` The speaker page in the organiser backend now has a direct link to send an email to that speaker.
- :feature:`457` You can now order submissions by the number of reviews they have received on the review page.
- :feature:`566` The Reply-To field now permits multiple email addresses.
- :bug:`579` When organisers changed the event time frame, already submitted availabilities would have to be changed upon new submission.
- :feature:`577` You can now decide if text lengths should be counted in words or in characters when restricting how long they should be.
- :bug:`587` pretalx did not automatically update a talk's duration when it was changed via the submission type or directly. It was only changed when you moved the talk in the schedule editor.
- :bug:`594` pretalx did not display speaker availabilities during submission, even when they were required, breaking submission workflows.
- :feature:`346` Due to the generous sponsorship of JuliaCon, pretalx is now capable of blind reviews, i.e. making sure that reviewers cannot see speaker names.
- :feature:`-` The organiser area has now additional, event specific login pages (at ``/orga/event/<slug>/login/``) which redirect by default to the event dashboard, and appear with the colour and logo of the event in question.
- :feature:`-` The review settings have moved from the CfP page to their own settings page.
- :feature:`-` You can now decide to add the ``robots=noindex`` meta tag to prevent bots from crawling your event pages.
- :feature:`-` Plugin developers can now use the ``is_available`` hook to decide if their plugin should be shown on a per-event basis.
- :bug:`-` Speaker without an avatar and with gravatar disabled had a broken avatar-image in the speaker's view in the organiser backend.
- :bug:`-` The visual representation of a speaker's avatar is now consistent across all image-sizes and bio-texts.
- :bug:`583` When signing up with an email address with upper case letters included, pretalx only allowed to log in with a lower-cased email address.
- :bug:`572` People who had only deleted submissions in an event were still shown in the submitter list, which was unexpected and was since fixed.
- :feature:`-` If only one conference language is available, pretalx doesn't as speakers to choose it from a drop-down, as this behaviour is rather silly.
- :support:`-` pretalx doesn't run ``regenerate_css`` on startup automatically any longer. This reduces startup times. If for any reason an event does not look as it should, you can fix it by running ``python -m pretalx regenerate_css``. You will also need to execute this command on updates from now on.
- :feature:`-` You can now decide if you want to notify speakers about their changed talks when releasing a new schedule.
- :support:`-` To help make other pretalx installations more secure, we've updated our proposed nginx configuration to include an attachment header for all files under /media, to prevent user uploaded data to be delivered directly to other users. If you host a pretalx instance, please make use of this option.
- :feature:`-` Since SVG files are nearly impossible to sanitise, pretalx has given up trying, and will no longer accept SVG files as image uploads.
- :bug:`-` The iCal export for speakers who had both scheduled and not-yet-scheduled talks was broken.
- :feature:`559` Organisers can download a list of speakers as a CSV file.
- :support:`-` A couple of URLs now end in a trailing slash where they did not before – you will be automatically redirected, so you don't have to worry about it unless you integrate pretalx somewhere without following redirects.
- :feature:`-` You can set the URL of your static HTML export, if you're using one, and it will be used when generating absolute URLs, e.g. in exports or emails.
- :release:`0.9.0 <2018-12-21>`
- :feature:`-` pretalx can now group talks in tracks. Each talk can be assigned a track (either by the submitter, or by the organiser). Tracks will be displayed in configurable colours in the public schedule. The feature is entirely optional, and you can continue using pretalx without tracks without any problem.
- :feature:`-` We tuned pretalx performance to be faster when showing the schedules of large conferences with several hundreds of talks.
- :feature:`538` The sneak peek view will only feature talks that have been accepted.
- :feature:`440` Organisers can now follow an RSS feed to see new submissions – you'll have to provide your authentication token in the RSS request header to authenticate.
- :feature:`-` You can now set the default pretalx system wide time zone and locale (defaulting to ``UTC`` and English).
- :bug:`544` Organisers could see the titles of speaker information notes of all events, not just the currently active one (they could not see the details or edit them).
- :feature:`504` The schedule page is now better printable.
- :bug:`-` A `bug <https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4878>` in celery could make running pretalx with asynchronous workers impossible. We've pinned an earlier celery version that doesn't show this problem.
- :support:`-` A new pretalx plugin adds media.ccc.de as a recording provider – this plugin replaces the previously inbuilt capacity of pretalx to provide recording iframes. (This functionality was never directly exposed and only accessible via the pretalx shell. It is now deprecated and will be removed in a later version.)
- :feature:`-` Plugins can now provide recording iframes (via the new ``register_recording_provider`` signal and other helpers).
- :feature:`-` The new ``nav_event_settings`` plugin signal allows plugins to integrate their own settings pages next to the pretalx core pages.
