Release Notes
=============

- :bug:`583` When signing up with an email address with upper case letters included, pretalx only allowed to log in with a lower-cased email address.
- :bug:`572` People who had only deleted submissions in an event were still shown in the submitter list, which was unexpected and was since fixed.
- :feature:`-` If only one conference language is available, pretalx doesn't as speakers to choose it from a drop-down, as this behaviour is rather silly.
- :support:`-` pretalx doesn't run ``regenerate_css`` on startup automatically any longer. This reduces startup times. If for any reason an event does not look as it should, you can fix it by running ``python -m pretalx regenerate_css``.
- :feature:`-` You can now decide if you want to notify speakers about their changed talks when releasing a new schedule.
- :support:`-` To help make other pretalx installations more secure, we've updated our proposed nginx configuration to include an attachment header for all files under /media, to prevent user uploaded data to be delivered directly to other users. If you host a pretalx instance, please make use of this option.
- :feature:`-` Since SVG files are nearly impossible to sanitize, pretalx has given up trying, and will no longer accept SVG files as image uploads.
- :bug:`-` The iCal export for speakers who had both scheduled and not-yet-scheduled talks was broken.
- :feature:`559` Organisers can download a list of speakers as a CSV file.
- :support:`-` A couple of URLs now end in a trailing slash where they did not before – you will be automatically redirected, so you don't have to worry about it unless you integrate pretalx somewhere without following redirects.
- :feature:`-` You can set the URL of your static HTML export, if you're using one, and it will be used when generating absolute URLs, e.g. in exports or emails.
- :release:`0.9.0 <2018-12-21>`
- :feature:`-` pretalx can now group talks in tracks. Each talk can be assigned a track (either by the submitter, or by the organiser). Tracks will be displayed in configurable colors in the public schedule. The feature is entirely optional, and you can continue using pretalx without tracks without any problem.
- :feature:`-` We tuned pretalx performance to be faster when showing the schedules of large conferences with several hundreds of talks.
- :feature:`538` The sneak peek view will only feature talks that have been accepted.
- :feature:`440` Organisers can now follow an RSS feed to see new submissions – you'll have to provide your authentication token in the RSS request header to authenticate.
- :feature:`-` You can now set the default pretalx system wide time zone and locale (defaulting to ``UTC`` and ``en``).
- :bug:`544` Organisers could see the titles of speaker information notes of all events, not just the currently active one (they could not see the details or edit them).
- :feature:`504` The schedule page is now better printable.
- :bug:`-` A `bug <https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/4878>` in celery could make running pretalx with asynchronous workers impossible. We've pinned an earlier celery version that doesn't show this problem.
- :support:`-` A new pretalx plugin adds media.ccc.de as a recording provider – this plugin replaces the previously inbuilt capacity of pretalx to provide recording iframes. (This functionality was never directly exposed and only accessible via the pretalx shell. It is now deprecated and will be removed in a later version.)
- :feature:`-` Plugins can now provide recording iframes (via the new ``register_recording_provider`` signal and other mixins).
- :feature:`-` The new ``nav_event_settings`` plugin signal allows plugins to integrate their own settings pages next to the pretalx core pages.
- :feature:`-` pretalx now presents a colorpicker for your event primary color, including a hint on color suitability.
- :feature:`-` The new `/api/me` endpoint shows name, email address, locale, and timezone of the logged in user.
- :feature:`-` The ``nav_event`` plugin signal has changed to expect a list instead of a dictionary response. The dictionary response will be supported for one more version, and raises a deprecation warning.
- :feature:`-` The API now provides a ``/rooms`` endpoint – this endpoint is public, so upgrading will publish which rooms you have configured in your conferences!
- :feature:`530` The API now provides a ``/reviews`` endpoint.
- :bug:`529` When trying to review their own submission, a user would see a 404 not found error instead of an explanation that this was a forbidden action.
- :bug:`-` The password reset form told users if they had already tried to reset their password in the last 24 hours. While this is helpful, it also allows user discovery via password reset. Instead, the user now sees a more generic message.
- :feature:`-` While filling out the submission form wizard, submitters see a top bar telling them where they are in the submission process.
- :bug:`-` The event dashboard showed a wrong countdown towards the CfP end while the CfP end was between three and one day away.
- :feature:`-` The new event dropdown helps you find your event, even if you have access to many events.
- :bug:`-` The organiser login page did not strip whitespace from login credentials.
- :bug:`524` Review settings contained the setting "Force data entry" twice, referring to the score and text, respectively.
- :bug:`522` If a speaker did not check a mandatory checkbox, they could not submit the form (as intended), but could see no feedback explaining the issue.
- :feature:`` The ``rebuild`` command now comes with a lot more build output for ease of debugging. You can disable the build output with the new ``--silent/-s`` flag.
- :feature:`476` Administrators can now delete both events and organisers.
- :feature:`493` Speaker email addresses are now available via the API for users with access permissions.
- :bug:`515` Under rare circumstances, the pretalx database could reach a state pretalx couldn't cope with due to duplicate schedule versions.
- :feature:`512` You can now configure if speakers should provide their availability during talk submission.
- :support:`-` Due to an updated Django version, pretalx has dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.3 and MySQL 5.5.
- :release:`0.8.0 <2018-09-23>`
- :bug:`-` When a user removed a submission containing an answered choice question, pretalx removed the selected answer option, too.
- :bug:`501` When a speaker held more than two talks, their related talks did not show up.
- :bug:`505` Custom CSS may now also include media queries.
- :bug:`500` Display of times could be off in the static HTML export.
- :support:`-` The URLs for schedule exports have changed from /myevent/schedule/export?exporter=exportername to /myevent/schedule/export/exportername – if you have hardcoded links to schedule exporters, please update them accordingly.
- :feature:`213` A human-readable time until the CfP closes now shows up next to the end time.
- :bug:`503` Not all current TLDs did end up included as URLs when processing markdown input to build links.
- :bug:`-` The schedule import in the organiser backend never worked (while the manage command for administrators did work).

- :bug:`-` If a review question was mandatory while submission questions were active, they would block the submission process.
- :feature:`-` Organisers can now also reset the password for the speakers they have access to.
- :bug:`488` The HTML export contained media files (not other content) from all conferences on an instance, instead of the exported conference.

- :feature:`-` The submission list now includes a graph of submissions over time.
- :feature:`-` You can now see the sneak peek / is_featured flag in the submissions and talk API endpoints.
- :feature:`-` You can now use your authentication token to access all pages you have access to, as you already could for the API. This makes integration of exports much easier.
- :support:`-` All manage commands available in pretalx are now included in the documentation.
- :feature:`240` When using paper cards to build a schedule, each card comes with a QR code link to a quick scheduling form for that submission.

- :bug:`473` Following the revamp of team permissions, override votes were missing from the settings. We re-introduced the settings, and improved the general handling of override votes.
- :support:`-` pretalx now doesn't support usernames any longer – as all users had to have email addresses already, you will now have to provide an email address to log in. This may confuse users – as an administrator, you can look up users' email addresses if they don't remember them, or change them, if necessary.
