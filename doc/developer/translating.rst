Translating pretalx
===================

pretalx has been translated to other languages, and what's more – you can use
pretalx in several languages for your event, which helps you to be accessible
to a diverse range of people. To make this work, the pretalx interfaces need to
be translated, too.

Translations are **community-sourced**, and **everybody is invited to help**
and make them more complete, improve phrasing, or even **add new languages**!

Official and unofficial languages
---------------------------------

Translations of pretalx are divided into official and unofficial languages.

Official languages
    are translated and maintained by the core team behind pretalx or as part of long-term partnerships. We are
    committed to keeping these translations up-to-date with new features or changes in pretalx and try to offer
    support in this language. Currently, only English and German are available as official languages.

Unofficial languages
    are contributed and maintained by the community. We ship them with pretalx so you can use them, but we can not
    guarantee that new or changed features in pretalx will be translated in time for a new release. Since we
    probably cannot speak the language in question, we cannot guarantee that the translations are
    correct.

All translations marked as unofficial community translations will offered with
a note of how many percent of pretalx they cover. You can see the current
status that will be included in the next release here:
