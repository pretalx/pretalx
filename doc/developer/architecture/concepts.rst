Concepts
========

This is how pretalx sees the world, and in particular how its data model tries
to model real-world issues.

Persons
-------

pretalx tries to treat its users as the persons they actually are. This
involves allowing people to be both organisers and speakers and attendees at
one or multiple events. Even submitting proposals to an event and then
reviewing other proposals is something pretalx allows (although the submitter
will never be able to see the reviews their own submission received).

It is expected that people can take part in as many events as they like, in any
role they like. Naturally, a non-bounded number of people can present any talk.

Events and organisers
---------------------

**Events** take place once, over the course of one or multiple days. Events
belong to an **organiser**, which is an entity that can take on one or multiple
events.

**Teams** run events or certain parts of events for an organiser. A team is
defined as a number of people who share the same rights and responsibilities
with regards to one or multiple events. People can be in multiple teams. A team
can run multiple events, and most events will have multiple teams associated
with them.

Submissions and Reviews
-----------------------

**Submissions** (or: proposals) are a cornerstone of how pretalx’s
understanding of the world. A submission will have at least a title and as many
other fields as the organisers have specified, either by requiring or removing
the built-in fields, or by adding questions of their own. A submission will
probably have one or multiple speakers.

Submissions have a **state**. They start out as *submitted*. While they are
submitted, they can be *deleted* or *withdrawn*. Organisers can then change the
submission state to *accepted* or *rejected* (typically after the CfP has
closed and the review phase is over). An *accepted* proposal can then be
*confirmed* by any of their speakers (or the organisers, who can set any
submission to any state, if need be).

Both *accepted* and *confirmed* submissions can be *canceled* to indicate that
a planned presentation will not take place after all.

Schedules and Slots
-------------------

A **schedule** is a versioned programme of an event. Any event will have at
least one schedule – the unreleased, work-in-progress schedule. At any time,
organisers can “freeze” this schedule to a released **version**, that will go
by a name organisers can choose. Speakers will receive updates if their
presentations have been moved, and attendees can look at the changelog to see
differences between versions.

**Slots** are the scheduled instances of a submission. Regularly, a submission
will have one slot per schedule, but submissions can also have more than that,
for example if a workshop will be held twice.
