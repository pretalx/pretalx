Code of Conduct
===============

Our Pledge
----------

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the
dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of
characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical
characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or
social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status.
The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates
in good faith and in accordance with this Code.

Our Standards
-------------

Behaviour that exemplifies our standards and values includes:

* Demonstrating kindness and honesty toward other people.
* Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
* Taking responsibility for our actions and contributions.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Repairing harm when it occurs.

In contrast, the following behaviours have no place in our community.
Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

* Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal
  attention after any clear request to stop.
* Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community
  member or group of people.
* The use of unwelcome sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual
  attention or advances of any kind.
* Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their
  permission.
* Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community and its
  members.
* Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else
  to evade enforcement actions.
* Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for failing to uphold this Code of
Conduct.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project team at support@pretalx.com. The project team will
review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to respect the
privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Notes
-----

As pretalx is currently a single-maintainer project, some of the above does not
apply directly to the project in its current state: If Tobias Kunze, the
current maintainer, fails to uphold this Code of Conduct, there is no other
leadership to hold him accountable or to address a complaint to. I have
nevertheless chosen to include those passages, both to be prepared for a larger
future maintainer group, and to make it clear that I consider myself just as
bound by this Code of Conduct as any other contributor.

Attribution
-----------

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the `Contributor Covenant`_, versions 1.4,
2.1 and 3.0.
