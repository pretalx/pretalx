Contributing to pretalx
=======================

.. highlight: console

You want to contribute? That’s great! Being an open source project, pretalx
thrives if it receives regular contributions from the community. Everyone is
able to contribute, and contributions can come in many forms: Code,
Documentation, :ref:`Translations<translating>`, Graphics, Feedback ….  We
appreciate them highly! If you’re not sure how to make something work, feel
free to `open a GitHub Discussion`_ about it.

Don’t forget to head over to :ref:`devsetup` to read about how to set up your
local copy of pretalx for development and testing.

Please note that we bound ourselves to a :ref:`coc` that applies to all
communication around the project. We do not tolerate any form of harassment.
