Creating custom views
=====================

This page describes how to provide a custom view from within your plugin. Before you start
reading this page, please read and understand how :ref:`URL handling <urlconf>` works in
pretalx.

.. _urlconf:

Organiser panel views
---------------------

If you want to add a custom view to the organiser area of an event, register an URL in your
``urls.py`` that lives in the ``/orga/`` subpath::

    from django.conf.urls import url

    from pretalx.event.models.event import SLUG_CHARS

    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        url(f'^orga/event/(?P<event>[{SLUG_CHARS}]+)/',
            views.admin_view, name='backend'),
        url(r'^(?P<event>[{SLUG_CHARS}]+)/p/mypluginname/',
            views.frontend_view, name='frontend'),
        url(r'^p/mypluginname/',
            views.global_view, name='global-frontend'),
    ]

If your view is event-specific, you have to name one parameter in your URL
``event``. By convention, all plugin URLs except for backend URLs start with
a ``/p/`` to avoid namespace collisions with event names and reserved URLs.

You can then write a regular view. Our middleware will automatically detect the
``/orga/`` subpath and will ensure the following points if this is an URL with
the ``event`` parameter:

* The user has logged in
* The ``request.event`` attribute contains the current event
* The user has permission to view the current event

If you want to require specific permission types, we provide you with a decorator or a mixin for
your views::

    from pretalx.common.mixins.views import PermissionRequired

    class AdminView(PermissionRequired, View):
        permission_required = 'can_view_orders'

        ...


There is also a signal that allows you to add the view to the event sidebar navigation like this::


    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from django.urls import resolve, reverse
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
    from pretalx.orga.signals import nav_event


    @receiver(nav_event, dispatch_uid='friends_tickets_nav')
    def navbar_info(sender, request, **kwargs):
        url = resolve(request.path_info)
        if not request.user.has_perm('can_see_orga_area', request.event):
            return []
        return [{
            'label': _('My plugin view'),
            'icon': 'heart',
            'url': reverse('plugins:myplugin:index', kwargs={
                'event': request.event.slug,
            }),
            'active': url.namespace == 'plugins:myplugin' and url.url_name == 'view',
        }]


Frontend views
--------------

Frontend views work pretty much like organiser area views. Take care that your URL starts
with ``/(P?P<event>[\]+)/``, or even better, ``/(P?P<event>[\]+)/p/``.
You can then write a regular view. It will be automatically ensured that:

* The requested event exists
* The requested event is visible (either by being public, or if an organiser looks at it)
* The request involves the correct domain for the event
* The ``request.event`` attribute contains the correct ``Event`` object
* The organiser has enabled the plugin
* The locale middleware has processed the request
