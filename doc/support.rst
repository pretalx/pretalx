Support & Services
==================

pretalx is `open-source`_ and used by hundreds of events worldwide, both on our hosted platform
and as self-hosted installations.

Hosted pretalx
--------------

The easiest way to run pretalx is on our hosted platform at `pretalx.com`_.
We handle backups, updates, and server administration, so you can focus on your event.
Pricing scales with your event's size, and discounts are available for community events.

Hosted customers get direct support and immediate access to all new features and bug fixes.

Feature commissions
-------------------

Need a specific feature for your event? You can commission features to get exactly what you need.
We'll scope, build, and ship the feature, and credit you in the documentation and on social media.
