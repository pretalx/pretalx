"""
This signal allows you to trigger additional events when a submission changes
its state. You will receive the submission after it has been saved, the previous
state, and the user triggering the change if available.
Any exceptions raised will be ignored.

As with all plugin signals, the ``sender`` keyword argument will contain the event.
Additionally, you will receive the keyword arguments ``submission``, ``old_state``,
and ``user`` (which may be ``None``).
When the submission is created or submitted from a draft state, ``old_state`` will be
``None``.
