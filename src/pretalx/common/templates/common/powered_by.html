    Hi, there!

    You have found the place that will allow you to remove or change the link to pretalx from all
    event websites. However, doing so will most likely violate the pretalx license:

    Building pretalx has taken a ton of time and work and dedication – all of it right in the open
    for people to see and to use. I’m busy adding new features all the time, and on the side I
    take care of the boring-but-vital maintenance work. Despite being free, pretalx plays in the
    same league as commercial platforms – or you probably wouldn’t be here, setting it up, right?

    I only make money from pretalx when people buy support contracts or use the hosting platform at
    https://pretalx.com. Now, this isn’t meant to be a money grab: I hope our installation docs and
    open approach make it clear that I want people to run their own instances! But a healthy project
    needs people to survive, and if you patch out the link to the project, those people – prospective
    contributors or customers – won’t find us. Without contributors and users and, yes, customers,
    pretalx will be less maintained and ultimately less useful to you.

    So this is why I changed the license and made specific provisions for the removal of the pretalx
    attribution in the website footer. Please make sure you read the license, particularly the intro
    containing the specific extra condition.

    Thank you,
    Tobias

    P.S.: If you find yourself interested in a support contract or paid feature development after all,
    you can reach me at sales@pretalx.com.
