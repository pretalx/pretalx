# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

currently supported. If you need support for previous releases, please contact
[support@pretalx.com](mailto:support@pretalx.com).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in pretalx, please contact [support@pretalx.com](mailto:support@pretalx.com). We will
respond in a timely manner. If appropriate, we will work with you on further processes/publishing and mitigation.

disclosure publication.
